WatchDirectory will inform you about file changes in specified directories.

You can get informed about certain files only using a filter and also filter on types of changes (e.g. new files, renamed files, changed files...)

All you need in your script is to call WatchDirectory with required parameters and additional report function which is the second parameter to WatchDirectory.
The report function must accepts 2 parameters:
  - When a file is changed, both parameters will contain same filename/path
  - When a file is deleted, first parameter contains the file/path and second parameter will be empty
  - When a new file is created, first parameter is empty and second parameter contains filename/path
  - When a file is renamed, first parameter contains old filename/path and second new filename/path

WatchDirectory syntax:
  WatchDirectory(dir[\*|...],ReportFunction,ActionFilter) accepts up to 3 parameters
  - dir, can be a folder/directory (last backslash is optional)
  - include * in the end of your directory to watch in sub folders
  - after that you can include file name filters separated by pipe '|', here you have following options:
    - use * and ? wildcard
    - include Back Slash in front = match beginning of filename
    - include Back Slash at the end = match end of filename
    - include Back Slash anywhere in the middle to search in complete file path
    - E.g. following will search for files that start with a and end with .txt or .ini
	WatchDirectory("C:\temp\*|.txt\|.ini\|\a","ReportChanges")
	- func, a function to be launched when changes in corresponding folder occur
	- when you omit func, last used function will be used
	- Your function must accept 2 parameters
	  - When new file is created:
	    - first parameter will be empty
	    - second parameter will contain the filepath
	      - When file is deleted
	      - second parameter will be empty
	      - first parameter will contain the filepath
	      - When file is modified both parameters contain same filepath
		- When file is renamed
		  - first parameter will contain old filename
		  - second parameter will contain new filename
	    - ActionFilter can be used to report only specific changes
		- therefore include one or several of following values i
		- FILE_NOTIFY_CHANGE_FILE_NAME=0x1
		- FILE_NOTIFY_CHANGE_DIR_NAME=0x2
		- FILE_NOTIFY_CHANGE_ATTRIBUTES=0x4
		- FILE_NOTIFY_CHANGE_SIZE=0x8
		- FILE_NOTIFY_CHANGE_LAST_WRITE=0x10
		- FILE_NOTIFY_CHANGE_CREATION=0x40
		- FILE_NOTIFY_CHANGE_SECURITY=0x100
		- these values must be separated by |, by default all changes are reported.
